## Satoshi Nakamoto's paper: Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf from 2008.

## Hyperledger Fabric – from The Linux Foundation – is the open source modular blockchain framework that has become the de facto standard for enterprise blockchain platforms.

### FYI: [Hyperledger Fabric documentation](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.0/)

### FYI: [Hyperledger Fabric code](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric)

## In addition to the Open Source Hyperledger Fabric there is the cloud-based IBM Blockchain Platform:

1. Deploy on IBM Cloud
2. Deploy using Software as a Service (SaaS) 
3. $0.29 USD
4. Price per Allocated CPU-Hour (VPC-hour)
ㅤㅤ ㅤㅤ ㅤㅤ
<p>IBM Cloud advantages:
1. No membership fees: Invest directly in your blockchain components
2. Estimation clarity: Simple hourly pricing model for easier cost control
3. Scalability to compute: Adjust compute up or down to minimize expense
4. Leverage your existing IBM Cloud services and components
5. Billing transparency: Pay as you go with updates on your dashboard
ㅤㅤ ㅤㅤ ㅤㅤ
Please note:  The IBM Blockchain Platform for IBM Cloud requires the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service and storage, which are billed separately.

# Hands-on Blockchain

Follow tutorials

### Tutorial 1 Local Smart Contract Development

<img src="/img/VSCode.png">

Follow the typical workflow from generating a new default smart contract project, deploying code to the Local Fabric environment, and testing out your transactions via an application gateway.

### Tutorial 2

Create a cloud blockchain deployment

After developing a smart contract against the local runtime, you'll need somewhere more permanent to deploy for further dev, proof of concept, or production use. IBM Blockchain Platform includes an offering on IBM Cloud for creating and operating a suitable runtime environment for such purposes. Its full name is "IBM Blockchain Platform on IBM Cloud", but for the sake of brevity we'll refer to it from here on out as "the cloud service". In this tutorial you will learn how to get a cloud environment set up using the cloud service.

### Tutorial 3

Deploying and transacting with IBM Cloud

Important: You will need a smart contract package and a suitable cloud environment to follow this tutorial. Follow parts 1 and 2 of this series first for instructions.
