Follow tutorials

# Tutorial 1

Local Smart Contract Development

Follow the typical workflow from generating a new default smart contract project, deploying code to the Local Fabric environment, and testing out your transactions via an application gateway.

# Tutorial 2

Create a cloud blockchain deployment

After developing a smart contract against the local runtime, you'll need somewhere more permanent to deploy for further dev, proof of concept, or production use. IBM Blockchain Platform includes an offering on IBM Cloud for creating and operating a suitable runtime environment for such purposes. Its full name is "IBM Blockchain Platform on IBM Cloud", but for the sake of brevity we'll refer to it from here on out as "the cloud service". In this tutorial you will learn how to get a cloud environment set up using the cloud service.


# Tutorial 3

Deploying and transacting with IBM Cloud

Important: You will need a smart contract package and a suitable cloud environment to follow this tutorial. Follow parts 1 and 2 of this series first for instructions.
