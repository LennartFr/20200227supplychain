3. $0.29 USD
4. Price per Allocated CPU-Hour (VPC-hour)
ㅤㅤ ㅤㅤ ㅤㅤ
<p>IBM Cloud advantages:
 
1. No membership fees: Invest directly in your blockchain components
2. Estimation clarity: Simple hourly pricing model for easier cost control
3. Scalability to compute: Adjust compute up or down to minimize expense
4. Leverage your existing IBM Cloud services and components
5. Billing transparency: Pay as you go with updates on your dashboard

<p>ㅤㅤ ㅤㅤ ㅤㅤ
Please note: The IBM Blockchain Platform for IBM Cloud requires the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service and storage, which are billed separately.

### All the documents in a shared ledger
TradeLens provides a common view of the documents associated with the different levels of a shipment as it moves toward its destination. All the documents are in a shared ledger rather than in file folders, hard drives or email inboxes throughout the supply chain.

#### Version control 

Each time a document is edited or uploaded, a new version is created and added to the platform without deleting or changing the old one. This is a blockchain feature that prevents documents from being lost and assists with dispute resolution.

#### Auditability

Our tool uses blockchain to create an immutable log that enables users to go back and see who made any change, when it was made and the prior versions of the document. The same tool enables authorities to easily trace a container’s origin and events throughout transit.

#### Collaboration 

Shippers rely on their customs brokers and freight forwarders to keep track of documents and send them around. TradeLens document tools let you work together with your 3PLs and customs brokers to manage and create key shipping documents across digital workflows.

#### Accessibility

Shippers have the ability within the platform to define who can access documents for their consignments, thanks to a unified permissions model based on international standards.

#### Immediate notification

Parties to the consignment such as customs brokers and inland transport providers are notified automatically when documents are added or updated, for dramatic time savings over the course of a shipment.


Real gains from document sharing are going to come from how TradeLens handles structured documents. This feature eliminates paper from the supply chain—and all its inefficiencies. It’s also going to transform work flows by reducing the need to manually enter the same data repeatedly. When a structured document goes in at the factory or port, the data will be instantly useable to the entire supply chain and accessible to those who have the correct permission to see it.

# Hands-on Blockchain

Follow tutorials

### Tutorial 1 Local Smart Contract Development

<img src="/img/VSCode.png">

Follow the typical workflow from generating a new default smart contract project, deploying code to the Local Fabric environment, and testing out your transactions via an application gateway.

### Tutorial 2

Create a cloud blockchain deployment

After developing a smart contract against the local runtime, you'll need somewhere more permanent to deploy for further dev, proof of concept, or production use. IBM Blockchain Platform includes an offering on IBM Cloud for creating and operating a suitable runtime environment for such purposes. Its full name is "IBM Blockchain Platform on IBM Cloud", but for the sake of brevity we'll refer to it from here on out as "the cloud service". In this tutorial you will learn how to get a cloud environment set up using the cloud service.

### Tutorial 3

Deploying and transacting with IBM Cloud

Important: You will need a smart contract package and a suitable cloud environment to follow this tutorial. Follow parts 1 and 2 of this series first for instructions.
