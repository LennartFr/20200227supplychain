Transform container logistics by freeing yourself from legacy data systems, manual document handling and poor visibility.


TradeLens uses IBM Blockchain technology as the foundation for digital supply chains, empowering multiple trading partners to collaborate by establishing a single shared view of a transaction without compromising details, privacy or confidentiality. Shippers, shipping lines, freight forwarders, port and terminal operators, inland transportation and customs authorities can interact more efficiently through real-time access to shipping data and shipping documents, including IoT and sensor data ranging from temperature control to container weight.

<p>
Using blockchain smart contracts, TradeLens enables digital collaboration across the multiple parties involved in international trade. The trade document module, released under a beta program and called ClearWay, enables importers/exporters, customs brokers, trusted third parties such as Customs, other government agencies, and NGOs to collaborate in cross-organizational business processes and information exchanges, all backed by a secure, non-repudiable audit trail.

### All the documents in a shared ledger
TradeLens provides a common view of the documents associated with the different levels of a shipment as it moves toward its destination. All the documents are in a shared ledger rather than in file folders, hard drives or email inboxes throughout the supply chain.

#### Version control 

Each time a document is edited or uploaded, a new version is created and added to the platform without deleting or changing the old one. This is a blockchain feature that prevents documents from being lost and assists with dispute resolution.

#### Auditability

Our tool uses blockchain to create an immutable log that enables users to go back and see who made any change, when it was made and the prior versions of the document. The same tool enables authorities to easily trace a container’s origin and events throughout transit.

#### Collaboration 

Shippers rely on their customs brokers and freight forwarders to keep track of documents and send them around. TradeLens document tools let you work together with your 3PLs and customs brokers to manage and create key shipping documents across digital workflows.

#### Accessibility

Shippers have the ability within the platform to define who can access documents for their consignments, thanks to a unified permissions model based on international standards.

#### Immediate notification

Parties to the consignment such as customs brokers and inland transport providers are notified automatically when documents are added or updated, for dramatic time savings over the course of a shipment.


Real gains from document sharing are going to come from how TradeLens handles structured documents. This feature eliminates paper from the supply chain—and all its inefficiencies. It’s also going to transform work flows by reducing the need to manually enter the same data repeatedly. When a structured document goes in at the factory or port, the data will be instantly useable to the entire supply chain and accessible to those who have the correct permission to see it.
